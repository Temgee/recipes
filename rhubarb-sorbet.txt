Yields about 1 & 1/2 quarts.

Ingredients:
4 cups chopped rhubarb
2 1/2 cups water
1 & 1/2 cups sugar
1/4 tsp salt
2 tbsp corn syrup

Instructions:
Bring rhubarb, water, sugar and salt to a boil in a saucepan. Turn down the heat and simmer for 4-5 minutes until rhubarb is tender and has lost all structure. Let cool for 5 minutes and puree with an immersion blender (or in a regular blender). Strain through a fine mesh sieve and mix in corn syrup. Cool at room temperature, then place in a sealed container in the fridge for a few hours until chilled.

Transfer to an ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer instructions. When sorbet is scoopable, transfer to a container and place in freezer to firm up a bit. I recommend serving it with some cake, or topping it with mint or basil.
